#Provide a table for all web_events associated with account name of Walmart. There should be three columns. 
Be sure to include the primary_poc, time of the event, and the channel for each event. Additionally, 
you might choose to add a fourth column to assure only Walmart events were chosen.

SELECT we.channel, we.occurred_at,a.primary_poc,a.name
FROM web_events AS we
JOIN accounts AS a
ON we.account_id = a.id
WHERE a.name = 'Walmart';
